In this repository, there are classes that describe monom and polynom equations and some diversity of actions that we can perform on them.
In addition, there is a complex function class that is made of mathematical operations between monom's and polynom's, and between one function and another. 
It is also possible to present these functions alongside a graphical representation of them, which we could save and upload, 
all based on the graphical library stddraw which allow all of this actions.further more,there are classes for testing Momom, Polynom and Complex function with JUnit 5.
